## How to Run Tests

1. Clone this repo:
   
git clone https://github.com/Yulia-QC/eviltester
cd eviltester

2. Run tests using Maven:

mvn clean test

## Sample Tests
The tests include:
Valid input (exactly 7 characters)
Too short input
Too long input
Empty input

## Note
Please note that the test page is currently not functioning due to a missing validation script.
Iâ€™ve documented the issue and added the test scenarios based on expected behavior using test design techniques such as boundary value analysis.
